# Hugo Starter Theme with Tailwind CSS

Starter files for a Hugo theme powered by Tailwind CSS **v4**.

- ships with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) v4 and the new `@tailwindcss/cli`
- uses [Hugo Pipes](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/) `css.TailwindCSS` to build styles for development and production
- `assets/css/styles.css` keeps Tailwind declarations in one place and uses `@source "hugo_stats.json";` for automatic tree shaking
- works as a separate theme repository or as a local theme folder within a Hugo site
- basic template setup with an index page, an about page, and a posts category
- responsive navigation header with minimal JavaScript to hide the nav on small screens
- sticky footer layout

## Prerequisites

- Hugo **Extended** (0.127+ recommended for Tailwind v4 support)
- Node.js for installing local dev dependencies (`tailwindcss`, `@tailwindcss/cli`, prettier plugins)

Install the Node dependencies once after cloning:

```bash
npm install
```

## Develop this repository as a standalone theme

1. Clone this repository (optionally rename the folder):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/meganii/gohugo-template-tailwindcss my-theme
   ```

2. Remove the starter Git history and re‑initialize if you are creating a new theme:

   ```bash
   cd my-theme
   rm -rf .git
   git init
   ```

3. Install the Node packages (Tailwind CSS CLI, prettier plugins):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Update the theme name in `exampleSite/hugo.toml` to match your folder name:

   ```toml
   # in exampleSite/hugo.toml
   theme = "my-theme"
   ```

5. Start a Hugo server that uses the example site and this theme:

   ```bash
   hugo server -s exampleSite --themesDir=../.. --disableFastRender
   ```

## Use as a theme inside an existing Hugo site

1. Create (or open) your Hugo site and add the theme under `themes/`:

   ```bash
   hugo new site new-site
   cd new-site/themes
   git clone https://github.com/meganii/gohugo-template-tailwindcss my-theme
   ```

2. Install the theme dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd my-theme
   npm install
   ```

3. Set the theme in your site configuration (e.g., `config.toml`, `config.yaml`, or `hugo.toml`):

   ```toml
   theme = "my-theme"
   ```

4. From the root of your site, run Hugo to develop locally:

   ```bash
   hugo server --disableFastRender
   ```

Your content lives in your site’s `content/` folder; layout development happens under `themes/my-theme/layouts/`.

## Tailwind CSS v4 workflow

- The entrypoint is `assets/css/styles.css`, which imports Tailwind, sets `@theme` font variables, and defines reusable component styles with `@layer` and `@apply`.
- `@source "hugo_stats.json";` enables Tailwind’s built-in content scanning using the stats file generated by Hugo.
- Styles are built via `layouts/partials/css.html`, which calls `css.TailwindCSS` with inline imports enabled. Assets are minified and fingerprinted automatically in production builds.
- `tailwind.config.js` is intentionally empty and exists only for editor IntelliSense; most customization happens directly in the CSS entrypoint.
- No separate PostCSS or PurgeCSS setup is required—Tailwind v4 and Hugo handle optimization out of the box.

## Reference

See the Hugo documentation for [Tailwind CSS with Hugo Pipes](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/tailwindcss/) to learn more about the pipeline used in this starter.
